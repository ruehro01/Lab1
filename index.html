    <h2>What do rainfall trends look like across the U.S. over the course of a year?</h2>
    <p>The United States has a wide array of climates and weather patterns. Part of this can be attributed to differences in latitude often primarily, but other things like the geographical features of a region play a large role as well. 
    
    The above topographic basemap shows features like forests in green and offers shaded relief as the user zooms in. Utilize the zoom and pan features to explore the United States! After you've explored some of the different geographic regions of the United States, give the time slider a try to see how rainfall patterns occur in different major cities in the U.S. over the course of the year. <b>Happy exploring!</b>
